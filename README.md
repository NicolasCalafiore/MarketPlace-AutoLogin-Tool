# Autologin Platform
## What the program is about (Version Independant)
This was a program I developed late 2021. For this program I developed an application that would auto-login to major online marketplaces and post preset information to all sites.

#### Created: Late 2021

## About Version One
 - Created Around Late 2021
 - Java
 - Swing (GUI)
 - Autologins to Major Online Marketplaces (Only 2 functional)
 - Extremely hardcoded and nested code
 - Extremely poorly structured
 - Lots of bugs and no modularity at all
 - I attempted animations very poorly
 - Not worth maintaining at all anymore and unusable.
 - Only used for a reference whenever I need to utilize Selenium in the future.
 - Even if there was a runnable application I wouldnt release this.
