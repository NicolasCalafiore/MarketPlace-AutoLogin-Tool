Objective:
  Utilize Selenium to create an interface for accessing multiple websites. Improve GUI design from CCv1


Functions:

  - Unfortunately it is near unoperable due to how I decided 

Notes:

  - This was a Java application that I was attempting to create when I first started getting into Swing and also Web-Scraping early 2020. Will be abandoned and re-written in C# WPF using better practices. This project is extremely un-modular and unintuitive. I also wanted to practice concurrency at the time so I had each buttons animation set to a different thread (it is now broken) but the use of Selenium was successful (currently the auto-login stage is unreachable but working). All these mistakes lead to fatal errors later on during development with extremely rigid, exploded systems and extremely unnecessary utilizations of threads and extremely inflexible animation system.

Date: circa. Early 2020

This project was created around 2019-2020 and will be abaandoned. Due to the extent of my errors and limited knowledge at the time I believe a new attempt at this program is necessary from scratch.
